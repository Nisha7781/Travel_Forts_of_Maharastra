    <p>The literal meaning of Maharashtra is “the great nation”, which is the land of <strong style="color: orangered; font-size: large;">chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</strong>.
       The land where you can still hear the echoes of the wars fought and where you can witness the glorious past and rich culture
       of the Marathas and the Mughals. Both empires created many pieces of architectural wonder that remained here to tell the story 
       of the bygone times. There are nearly 350 forts in Maharashtra that attract many architecture enthusiasts from different parts 
       of the nation.
       <br>
       We are happy to make the tourist & travellers aware about these places and guiding them to the heritage of our maharashtras culture</p>
